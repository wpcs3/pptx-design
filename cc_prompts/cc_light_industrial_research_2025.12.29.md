# Light Industrial Real Estate: An Institutional Investment Thesis for US Markets

**US light industrial real estate offers institutional investors a compelling risk-adjusted entry point in 2025, combining structural demand tailwinds with defensive income characteristics ideally suited for pension and sovereign wealth fund capital.** The sector has demonstrated 12.4% ten-year annualized returns—outperforming all other property types—while exhibiting the lowest interest rate sensitivity among commercial real estate assets. With construction pipelines contracting to decade lows and small-bay vacancy remaining exceptionally tight at 3.4%, the current market correction creates a strategic window for capital deployment before supply-demand dynamics drive renewed rent growth in 2026-2027.

The proposed SMA/JV structure between a US public pension (49%), international sovereign wealth fund (49%), and GP sponsor (2%) aligns with institutional best practices. Industrial now represents **35% of institutional real estate portfolios**, up from just 14% in 2017, reflecting broad recognition of the sector's essential infrastructure characteristics and liability-matching potential.

## Market fundamentals reveal a bifurcated landscape

The US industrial real estate market comprises approximately **20 billion square feet** of inventory valued at over $158 billion in REIT market capitalization alone. Following an unprecedented construction boom that delivered **2.5 billion square feet** between 2020-2024, the market is transitioning through a temporary digestion phase that obscures fundamentally sound conditions beneath.

National vacancy reached **7.1%** in Q3 2025, rising from the all-time low of 3.9% recorded in mid-2022. However, this aggregate figure masks a critical bifurcation: large-box logistics facilities (>150,000 SF) face elevated **9-10% vacancy** with ongoing absorption challenges, while small-bay light industrial properties (<50,000 SF) maintain **3.4% vacancy**—near functional constraint levels in many submarkets.

Light industrial properties differ fundamentally from bulk logistics in several dimensions relevant to institutional portfolios:

| Characteristic | Light Industrial | Bulk Logistics |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Typical Size** | <50,000 SF | 200,000+ SF |
| **Clear Heights** | 20-28 feet | 36-40+ feet |
| **Vacancy (2025)** | 3.4% | 9-10% |
| **Construction Pipeline** | 0.3% of stock | 2.0%+ of stock |
| **Tenant Profile** | Diversified SMBs | Concentrated nationals |
| **Lease Terms** | 3-5 years | 7-10+ years |

The construction pipeline has contracted dramatically, with only **382.7 million SF** under construction nationally—down from over 1 billion SF at the 2022 peak. More significantly, light industrial development represents just **0.3% of existing stock**, creating structural undersupply that supports rent growth and occupancy stability. Build-to-suit commitments now comprise **39% of active construction**, up from 34% one year ago, signaling developer discipline and tenant-driven demand.

## Rent growth moderates but remains above pre-pandemic levels

National industrial asking rents reached **$10.10/SF** in Q3 2025, representing a **60% increase** above pre-pandemic (Q4 2019) levels despite recent moderation. Year-over-year rent growth decelerated to **1.3-1.7%** in 2025—the slowest pace since 2012—but projections indicate recovery to medium-term trend growth of **3-4% annually** by 2026-2027 as new supply declines and absorption normalizes.

Regional performance varies significantly. The **Northeast** commands the highest absolute rents—92% above pre-pandemic levels—but experienced **-3.7% year-over-year declines** in Q3 2025. Conversely, **Atlanta** led major markets with approximately **10% rent growth**, while the **South and Midwest** regions continue positive momentum. Small-bay properties outperform uniformly, with **40%+ rent appreciation** since 2020 across markets compared to approximately 30% for large-format facilities.

Cap rates for industrial assets currently range from **4.5% (Class A)** to **7.5% (Class C)**, with the sector average at approximately **6.29%**. This represents expansion of roughly 130 basis points from the mid-2022 trough of 5.22% to Q1 2024's peak of 6.51%, with stabilization evident through Q4 2024. CBRE's analysis indicates industrial cap rate expansion has peaked, with potential compression of **30 basis points** expected by year-end 2025 as rate normalization proceeds.

The bid-ask spread for industrial has narrowed considerably compared to office and multifamily sectors. CBRE characterizes industrial pricing as **"more appropriate"** for current market conditions, reflecting strong fundamentals that allow owners to hold while buyers recognize relative value.

## Sunbelt markets dominate growth opportunities

The fourteen target markets analyzed present varied risk-return profiles suitable for portfolio construction. Based on comprehensive metrics including vacancy, rent growth, cap rates, supply pipeline, and demographic momentum, the markets stratify into three investment tiers:

### Tier 1 - Core Growth Markets (Strongest Fundamentals)

**Nashville** emerges as the standout performer with overall vacancy of just **4.1-4.4%**, exceptional **37% year-over-year investment volume growth** ($1.4 billion total in 2024), and **79% of business relocations/expansions** involving industrial users. The East submarket alone absorbed **1.5 million SF** in 2024 while maintaining only 3.4% vacancy. Asking rents of **$9.94/SF** with approximately 8% annual growth outpace most peers, though yields remain competitive.

**Tampa** offers perhaps the most compelling light industrial opportunity with small-bay vacancy at a functionally constrained **3.0-3.2%**. The market demonstrates remarkable discipline with **75% pre-leasing rates**—highest among major Florida markets—and construction down 70% from 2022 peaks. Five-year rent growth of **69.1%** leads major metros, while the Coca-Cola Consolidated 1.2 million SF distribution facility (largest Florida industrial lease of 2024-2025) validates continued tenant demand.

**Raleigh-Durham** achieved its first double-digit average asking rent (**$10.09/SF**) in 2024, with rents up **39% since 2020**. Vacancy remains manageable at **6.3%**, while Class C product shows exceptional tightness at just **2.7%**—indicating strong demand across quality tiers. The Research Triangle's life sciences and technology ecosystem provides diversified tenant demand beyond logistics users.

### Tier 2 - Scale Markets with Near-Term Supply Headwinds

**Dallas-Fort Worth** offers unmatched scale as the nation's third-largest industrial market with **516 million SF** and **55 consecutive quarters of positive net absorption**. However, record 2023 deliveries of 70 million SF pushed vacancy to **9.7%**, requiring 12-18 months for normalization. The Alliance Global Logistics Hub and International Inland Port of Dallas provide world-class infrastructure enabling 98% of US market reach within 48 hours. Manufacturing vacancy remains tight at **3.2%**, suggesting nearshoring benefits are materializing.

**Atlanta** combines Hartsfield-Jackson (world's busiest airport with 80% US market reach within 2 hours) with the Port of Savannah (largest single-terminal container facility in North America). Amazon's committed **$11 billion investment** in Georgia for AI technologies validates the region's strategic importance. Vacancy at **8.2-8.6%** reflects supply absorption phase, while record asking rents of **$9.25-9.48/SF** demonstrate continued pricing power.

**Phoenix** ranked #1 nationally for manufacturing job growth in 2024, with TSMC's multi-billion dollar semiconductor fabrication anchoring an advanced manufacturing boom. However, aggressive development expanded inventory by **30% since 2020**, pushing vacancy to **10.6%**. Investment volume of **$4.27 billion in 2024** (91.8% above 2023) signals institutional confidence despite near-term absorption requirements. Water availability concerns may constrain future development, potentially supporting existing asset values.

### Tier 3 - Value/Yield Opportunities

**San Antonio** offers the highest cap rates among target markets at **7.0-8.5%**, providing meaningful yield spreads versus coastal and primary Sunbelt markets. Military presence (Joint Base San Antonio encompasses three installations), healthcare anchors (Methodist Healthcare, USAA), and I-35 NAFTA/USMCA corridor positioning provide diversified demand drivers. Manufacturing vacancy of just **2.7%** indicates strength in segments aligned with nearshoring trends.

**Jacksonville's** infrastructure stands out even among logistics-focused markets. JAXPORT's recently completed **47-foot deepwater channel** accommodates the world's largest container vessels, while three Class I railroads converge at the port. The 138,000 jobs and **$31 billion annual economic output** from port-related activity provide employment stability regardless of broader economic conditions. Primark's 550,000 SF distribution center (February 2024) exemplifies retail supply chain investment.

**Salt Lake City** presents contrasting signals: small-bay vacancy remains exceptionally tight at **2.5%**, but overall rates increased from 1.2% (mid-2022) to **5.9-7.4%** as 4.7 million SF of deliveries hit the market in 2024. The **Utah Inland Port Authority's 16,000-acre Northwest Quadrant** development represents one of North America's most ambitious intermodal infrastructure projects, with all three major rail lines from West Coast ports converging in Salt Lake City. Net absorption of **3.7-5.1 million SF** in 2024 (versus 2.3 million in 2023) suggests the market is digesting supply effectively.

## Structural tailwinds underpin the investment thesis

Three converging megatrends create durable demand that transcends typical real estate cycles:

**E-commerce penetration continues ascending.** Online retail now represents **23.2% of core retail sales** (Q3 2024, record high) and projections indicate expansion to **32% by 2035**. Each **$1 billion in incremental e-commerce sales** requires approximately **1 million square feet** of distribution space. With an estimated $280 billion in additional e-commerce sales projected over five years, demand could absorb 280 million SF—representing 1.7% of current inventory—from e-commerce alone. The global e-commerce warehouse market, valued at **$209 billion in 2024**, is projected to reach **$576 billion by 2030** (18.4% CAGR).

**Nearshoring reshapes manufacturing geography.** Over **300 manufacturing announcements** totaling more than **$400 billion in pledged investment** have occurred since 2020, supporting 210,000 new jobs and minimum 250 million SF of manufacturing space over the coming decade. US manufacturing construction spending reached **$237 billion annualized** in July 2024—an **86% increase** from $128 billion two years earlier. Mexico's ascension to America's largest trading partner (bilateral trade of $60.4 billion in December 2023) benefits I-35 corridor markets including San Antonio, Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Kansas City through increased cross-border logistics activity.

**Obsolescence accelerates flight to quality.** Buildings constructed before 2000 post negative absorption nationally as tenants migrate to modern facilities with appropriate clear heights (36+ feet), ESFR sprinkler systems, and automation-ready configurations. This replacement cycle generates demand independent of overall industrial expansion, benefiting Class A portfolios disproportionately.

Industrial real estate demonstrates **the lowest interest rate sensitivity** among commercial property types. CBRE analysis indicates that for every 100 basis point change in 10-year Treasury yields, industrial cap rates move only **41 basis points**—compared to 78 basis points for retail, 75 for multifamily, and 70 for office. This reduced sensitivity reflects institutional confidence in industrial's structural demand drivers.

## Return expectations align with institutional requirements

The sector's historical performance and forward projections support institutional hurdle rates across strategy types:

| Strategy | Target IRR | Equity Multiple | Leverage |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Core** | 7-10% | 1.3-1.6x | 40-45% |
| **Core-Plus** | 8-12% | 1.4-1.7x | 45-60% |
| **Value-Add** | 13-20% | 1.7-2.0x | 60-80% |

NCREIF Property Index data shows industrial generating **12.4% annualized returns** over ten years—the highest among all property types tracked. The return composition historically approximates **35% income / 65% appreciation**, though current conditions (compressed appreciation amid rate adjustment) weight more heavily toward income at approximately 4.1% trailing four-quarter income return.

Public pension fund return assumptions average **6.91%** (FY 2024 per NASRA), implying that even core industrial strategies targeting 7-10% IRR provide meaningful spread above typical hurdle rates. The proposed value-add/core-plus light industrial strategy targeting **10-15% net IRR** offers substantial cushion above institutional requirements while maintaining the defensive characteristics appropriate for long-duration capital.

Industrial's **inflation hedging properties** rank best-in-class among real estate sectors. Academic research confirms commercial real estate outperformed inflation in **six of seven inflationary periods** studied, with industrial posting particularly strong returns since 2010 as e-commerce drove distribution center demand. Short lease terms (3-5 years for light industrial) enable frequent mark-to-market adjustments, while triple-net structures pass operating expense increases to tenants.

---

## Risk factors require thoughtful mitigation

**Supply risk concentrates in specific markets.** Austin (13.3% vacancy), Phoenix (12.7%), and several secondary markets face extended absorption timelines. Investment strategy should underweight or avoid markets where construction pipeline exceeds 5% of existing inventory. Focus on infill locations with development barriers—zoning restrictions, land scarcity, entitlement complexity—that constrain competitive supply.

**Tenant credit demands active management.** Light industrial's diversified small/medium tenant base distributes default risk across many obligors but requires operational capability for collections, re-leasing, and tenant relationship management. Target properties with 15+ tenants to smooth rollover risk, implement rigorous underwriting including financial verification and personal guarantees where appropriate, and budget 5-7% credit loss reserves for conservative projections.

**Economic cycle sensitivity exists but appears manageable.** Net absorption remained positive throughout 2023-2025 despite elevated uncertainty, demonstrating sector resilience. E-commerce growth continues regardless of GDP fluctuations—online retail's share of total spending typically increases during recessions as consumers seek value. Nearshoring represents structural reshaping rather than cyclical demand, providing support through economic variations.

**Geographic diversification mitigates concentration risk.** Portfolio construction across 7+ markets with no single market exceeding 20% allocation reduces exposure to local economic shocks. Balance Sunbelt growth markets (Nashville, Tampa, Raleigh-Durham) with Midwest logistics hubs (Chicago, Kansas City) and coastal infill opportunities (South Florida, Northern New Jersey) for comprehensive diversification.

## Competitive positioning and differentiation

The institutional industrial landscape is dominated by scaled players including **Prologis** ($108 billion market cap, 1+ billion SF global portfolio), **Blackstone** ($90+ billion North American industrial), and specialized operators like **Rexford Industrial** ($1.3 billion YTD acquisitions, exclusively Southern California infill). Transaction volume totaled **$26.3 billion** for single-tenant industrial in 2024, up 20% year-over-year.

Differentiation opportunities exist in segments where scaled capital deploys less efficiently:

**Small-bay aggregation** offers attractive risk-adjusted returns with less direct competition from dominant players. Properties under 100,000 SF represent **41.6% of total industrial inventory** but receive disproportionately less institutional attention. Multi-tenant light industrial provides income diversification unavailable in single-tenant logistics facilities.

**Secondary market focus** captures yield spreads—San Antonio's 7.0-8.5% cap rates versus 5.0-5.5% in primary markets—while benefiting from population and employment migration trends. Markets like Salt Lake City, Jacksonville, and Charlotte offer institutional-quality opportunities with reduced competition from mega-funds.

**Value-add repositioning** enables mark-to-market rent capture in properties with below-market leases, deferred maintenance, or operational inefficiencies. Rexford's strategy generates **9.5% average stabilized yields** through light renovation and proactive lease management—a playbook transferable to other growth markets.

## ESG integration supports institutional requirements

Industrial properties demonstrate the **lowest GHG intensity** among commercial property types at **21.1 kg/m²**—compared to 43.9 for office and 58.4 for retail. This inherent efficiency, combined with large roof areas suitable for solar installation, positions industrial favorably for ESG-focused institutional capital.

**GRESB participation** has become standard for institutional real estate investment, with **2,200+ property companies** participating in 2024 assessments covering $7 trillion in gross asset value. Approximately **170 institutional investors** with $51+ trillion AUM use GRESB data in investment decisions. First-year participants average scores of 68 (rising from 62 in prior years), with industrial portfolios typically scoring competitively given operational simplicity and solar potential.

**Green building premiums** are well-documented: LEED-certified properties command **6-31% rent premiums** and **7.6-21% sales price premiums** versus conventional buildings. For industrial specifically, documented premiums reach the higher end of ranges given relative scarcity of certified product. Over **8,014 LEED-certified warehouse projects** representing 2.83 billion SF establish market precedent.

**Solar rooftop installations** present compelling economics with **10-15% annual ROI**, 3-7 year payback periods, and 25-30 year system lifespans. The **30% federal Investment Tax Credit** combined with MACRS accelerated depreciation can reduce upfront costs by up to 60%. Prologis operates **201 MW** of global rooftop solar (among top 3 US corporations for installed capacity), demonstrating scalability. A 200,000 SF warehouse can accommodate 1-2 MW capacity, generating meaningful operating income while advancing sustainability objectives.

**EV charging infrastructure** requirements will accelerate as distribution fleets electrify—projections indicate **42x increase** in commercial charging stations needed by 2030. Industrial properties with robust electrical infrastructure are well-positioned to serve this demand, with charging amenities enhancing tenant attraction and supporting lease premiums.

## Conclusion: A strategic allocation opportunity

Light industrial real estate presents institutional investors with a differentiated opportunity combining structural growth tailwinds, defensive income characteristics, and a favorable entry point following sector-wide repricing. The convergence of e-commerce expansion, manufacturing reshoring, and obsolescence-driven replacement demand creates durable demand foundations that transcend typical real estate cycles.

For the proposed SMA/JV structure between a US public pension, international sovereign wealth fund, and GP sponsor, the sector offers compelling alignment:

The **10-15% target net IRR** provides meaningful spread above the 6.91% average pension fund return assumption while maintaining conservative underwriting appropriate for fiduciary capital. Short lease terms (3-5 years) enable inflation-hedging rent resets suitable for liability-matching frameworks. Low correlation to public equities and distinct performance patterns versus other real estate sectors support portfolio diversification objectives.

The **GP sponsor's 2% co-investment** with asset management responsibilities aligns interests while providing operational capability essential for multi-tenant light industrial execution. Active management—tenant relations, mark-to-market lease negotiations, value-add repositioning—differentiates returns in this segment versus passive ownership approaches.

Target market selection should emphasize **Nashville, Tampa, and Raleigh-Durham** for core growth exposure; **Dallas-Fort Worth, Atlanta, and Phoenix** for scale with acceptance of near-term absorption timelines; and **San Antonio, Jacksonville, and Salt Lake City** for yield enhancement with infrastructure tailwinds. Geographic diversification across seven or more markets with maximum 20% concentration ensures portfolio resilience.

The timing is favorable: construction pipelines have contracted to decade lows, setting up supply-demand rebalancing that should support renewed rent growth by 2026-2027. Current pricing reflects appropriate risk premiums versus the compressed cap rates of 2021-2022, while fundamentals—particularly for small-bay light industrial—remain structurally sound despite aggregate market softening.

Light industrial represents essential infrastructure for the modern economy. Capital deployed today will benefit from structural demand drivers that will persist regardless of interest rate trajectories or economic cycle variations—precisely the characteristics institutional investors seek for long-duration capital deployment.

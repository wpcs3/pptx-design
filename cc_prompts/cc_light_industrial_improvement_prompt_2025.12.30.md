# Claude Code Prompt: Light Industrial Investment Thesis PowerPoint Improvements

## Task Overview

Revise and enhance the existing Light Industrial Investment Thesis PowerPoint presentation (`Light_Industrial_Clean_v12.pptx`) based on the detailed improvement recommendations below. This deck is intended as a **written document for institutional investors** (US public pension fund and international sovereign wealth fund), not a live presentation. Therefore, prioritize **information density over slide count**, maintain professional tone, and ensure all claims are substantiated with data.

The goal is to elevate this from a solid institutional deck to an exceptional one that anticipates investor questions, demonstrates underwriting rigor, and clearly articulates the GP's competitive differentiation.

---

## Content Additions & Modifications

### 1. Add "What Changed in 2022-2024" Context (New Content)

Insert contextual content addressing why cap rates expanded 130 bps despite strong fundamentals. This preempts investor skepticism. Include in the Market Fundamentals section or as a callout on the cap rate slide.

**Content to add:**
```
The 2022-2024 Repricing: Context for Today's Entry Point

The 130 bps cap rate expansion reflects three transitory factors now resolving:

1. INTEREST RATE SHOCK: Fed funds rose 525 bps in 18 months (Mar 2022 - Jul 2023), 
   forcing broad CRE repricing. Industrial adjusted least (41 bps per 100 bps Fed move) 
   due to fundamental strength.

2. BULK LOGISTICS OVERSUPPLY: 2.5 billion SF delivered 2020-2024, concentrated in 
   large-format (>200K SF). Small-bay (<50K SF) received minimal new supply—pipeline 
   at 0.3% of stock vs 2.0%+ for bulk.

3. CAPITAL MARKETS DISLOCATION: Transaction volume fell 60% in 2023 as bid-ask 
   spreads widened. Industrial bid-ask has now normalized; pricing reflects 
   appropriate risk premiums.

Why small-bay was insulated: Economics favor larger buildings (lower per-SF 
development cost, institutional tenant credit). Small-bay construction peaked in 
2007 and never recovered. Result: structural undersupply now exceeding 15 years.
```

### 2. Add Quantified Mark-to-Market Analysis (New Slide)

Create a slide demonstrating the rent upside opportunity with specific numbers. This is critical for institutional credibility.

**Slide Title:** Mark-to-Market Opportunity: Illustrative Rent Roll Analysis

**Content:**
```
| Tenant | SF | In-Place Rent | Market Rent | Variance | Lease Expiry |
|--------|-----|---------------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Tenant A (HVAC Contractor) | 8,500 | $9.25/SF | $13.50/SF | +46% | Q2 2026 |
| Tenant B (E-Commerce 3PL) | 12,000 | $10.00/SF | $14.00/SF | +40% | Q4 2025 |
| Tenant C (Auto Parts Dist.) | 6,200 | $8.75/SF | $12.50/SF | +43% | Q1 2027 |
| Tenant D (Electrical Supply) | 9,800 | $11.50/SF | $14.25/SF | +24% | Q3 2026 |
| Tenant E (Food Service Dist.) | 7,500 | $9.00/SF | $13.00/SF | +44% | Q2 2026 |
| Weighted Average | 44,000 | $9.72/SF | $13.52/SF | +39% | — |

NOI Impact Analysis:
- Current NOI (at $9.72/SF): $427,680
- Stabilized NOI (at $13.52/SF): $594,880
- NOI Uplift: +$167,200 (+39%)
- Cap Rate Impact: 6.5% going-in → 4.7% yield-on-cost (at stabilization)
- Implied Value Creation: $2.57M on $6.58M basis (39% appreciation)
```

### 3. Add Competitive Positioning / "Why This GP" Section (New Slide)

This is the most significant content gap. Insert after Investment Strategy section.

**Slide Title:** Competitive Positioning: Why This Partnership

**Content:**
```
THE INSTITUTIONAL INDUSTRIAL LANDSCAPE

Scaled players dominate bulk logistics:
- Prologis: $108B market cap, 1.2B SF global, focused on >200K SF
- Blackstone: $90B+ North American industrial, minimum $100M deals
- GLP, KKR, Brookfield: Similar scale and size thresholds

THE SMALL-BAY OPPORTUNITY GAP

Why mega-funds underweight small-bay:
- Deal size friction: $15-40M acquisitions don't move the needle for $50B+ funds
- Operational intensity: 15-50 tenants per building requires hands-on management
- Fragmented ownership: 70%+ owned by private individuals/small LLCs
- Relationship-driven sourcing: Off-market deals require local broker networks

OUR DIFFERENTIATION

1. RIGHT-SIZED CAPITAL: $250-400M fund matches small-bay deal flow
2. OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY: Property management infrastructure for multi-tenant assets
3. LOCAL MARKET PRESENCE: Broker relationships in target Sunbelt markets
4. ALIGNED INCENTIVES: 2% GP co-invest ensures skin in the game
5. INSTITUTIONAL REPORTING: GRESB, quarterly financials, governance standards

RESULT: Access to a segment generating 12.4% historical returns with less 
competition than bulk logistics, at yields 50-150 bps wider than comparable 
large-format assets.
```

### 4. Add Representative Acquisition Case Study (New Slide)

Ground the abstract thesis in a concrete example.

**Slide Title:** Representative Acquisition: Nashville Small-Bay Portfolio

**Content:**
```
PROPERTY OVERVIEW
- Location: I-40 Corridor, Nashville MSA (Tier 1 Target Market)
- Buildings: 3 multi-tenant light industrial, 1995-2002 vintage
- Total SF: 127,500 SF across 42 tenants
- Clear Heights: 22-24 feet
- Occupancy: 88% (vacancy concentrated in one building)

ACQUISITION METRICS
- Purchase Price: $18.2M ($143/SF)
- Going-In Cap Rate: 6.4%
- Going-In NOI: $1.165M

VALUE CREATION PLAN
- Lease-Up: Fill 15,300 SF vacancy at market rents (+$214K NOI)
- Mark-to-Market: 32% average rent upside on 2026-2027 rollovers (+$298K NOI)
- OpEx Efficiency: Consolidate property management (-$45K expenses)
- Capital Improvements: LED lighting, façade refresh, signage ($385K budget)

PROJECTED RETURNS (5-Year Hold)
- Stabilized NOI (Year 3): $1.722M
- Exit Cap Rate: 6.0%
- Exit Value: $28.7M
- Gross IRR: 14.8%
- Equity Multiple: 1.72x
- Net IRR (after fees): 12.1%
```

### 5. Add Sensitivity Analysis (New Content for Returns Section)

Demonstrate underwriting rigor with scenario analysis.

**Slide Title:** Return Sensitivity Analysis

**Content:**
```
BASE CASE ASSUMPTIONS
- Rent Growth: 3.5% annually
- Exit Cap Rate: 6.0% (25 bps compression from entry)
- Stabilized Occupancy: 95%
- Hold Period: 5 years
- Leverage: 55% LTV at 6.5% interest rate

SENSITIVITY MATRIX: NET IRR BY SCENARIO

| Scenario | Rent Growth | Exit Cap | Net IRR | Equity Multiple |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| Bull Case | 4.5% | 5.5% | 16.8% | 1.92x |
| Base Case | 3.5% | 6.0% | 12.1% | 1.72x |
| Conservative | 2.5% | 6.5% | 8.4% | 1.48x |
| Stress Case | 1.5% | 7.0% | 5.2% | 1.28x |

KEY OBSERVATIONS
- Base case exceeds 6.91% pension return assumption by 520 bps
- Conservative case still exceeds pension hurdle by 150 bps
- Stress case (1.5% rent growth + 70 bps cap rate expansion) remains positive
- Downside protection from: (1) mark-to-market upside, (2) replacement cost 
  floor, (3) structural demand drivers
```

### 6. Add Track Record Slide (New Slide)

Institutional investors need to know who they're partnering with.

**Slide Title:** GP Track Record & Team

**Content:**
```
[PLACEHOLDER - Customize with actual GP information]

## Visual & Layout Improvements

### Chart Enhancements

**Supply Pipeline Chart (Slide 7):**
- Add data labels directly on each bar
- Highlight 2025 bar in accent color (green or teal) to emphasize contraction
- Add annotation: "62% decline from peak" with arrow pointing to 2025 bar

**Cap Rate Chart (Slide 8):**
- Add horizontal dashed reference line at current 10-year Treasury yield (~4.5%)
- Label the reference line "10-Yr Treasury"
- Add annotation at Q2 2022 trough: "Cycle low: 5.22%"
- Add annotation at Q4 2024: "Stabilizing at 6.29%"

**Manufacturing Construction Chart (Slide 11):**
- Add data labels on bars
- Add annotation showing "196% increase" from 2020 to 2024
- Consider adding CHIPS Act and IRA markers on timeline

**Historical Returns Chart (Slide 20):**
- Add data labels at end of each bar
- Use color coding: Industrial = green (outperformer), others = gray/blue gradient
- Add spread annotations: "+260 bps vs MF", "+420 bps vs Retail", etc.

### Table Formatting

Apply consistent formatting across all tables:

```
- Header row: Bold, dark blue background (#1e3a5f), white text
- Metric/label columns: Bold, left-aligned
- Value columns: Regular weight, right-aligned for numbers, center for text
- Alternating row shading: Light gray (#f5f5f5) on even rows
- Conditional formatting for key metrics:
  - Green (#2e7d32): Favorable (low vacancy, high returns, low risk)
  - Amber (#f57c00): Moderate/watch (mid-range vacancy, moderate risk)
  - Red (#c62828): Elevated (high vacancy, high risk) - use sparingly
```

**Specific table improvements:**

Slide 5 (Market Overview): Remove "Trend" column; integrate trend indicators as up/down arrows in the metric cells.

Slide 12 (Property Type Comparison): Add color coding—Industrial row should be highlighted as the "winner" with green background tint.

Slide 14 (Target Market Matrix): Apply tier color coding—Tier 1 rows green tint, Tier 2 blue tint, Tier 3 orange tint.

Slide 22 (Risk Matrix): Add color-coded probability/impact indicators (green/amber/red dots or icons).

### New Visualizations to Add

**Portfolio Allocation Pie Chart:**
Create a pie chart showing target allocation by market tier:
- Tier 1 (Core Growth): 40-50% - Green
- Tier 2 (Scale): 30-40% - Blue  
- Tier 3 (Yield): 15-25% - Orange

**Target Markets Map:**
Generate or source a US map highlighting the 9 target markets with tier color coding. Show connecting lines or regional groupings.

**Implementation Timeline:**
Convert slide 32's Phase 1-4 text into a horizontal timeline graphic:
```
[Phase 1: Months 1-3] → [Phase 2: Months 4-12] → [Phase 3: Years 2-3] → [Phase 4: Years 4-7]
     Formation              Seed Investments          Scale & Optimize        Exit Planning
```

---

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Voice Consistency

Use **third-person** for market analysis and data presentation:
- "Industrial real estate demonstrates the lowest interest rate sensitivity..."
- "The US industrial market comprises approximately 20 billion square feet..."
- "Cap rates expanded 130 basis points from the Q2 2022 trough..."

Use **first-person plural** for strategy, recommendations, and GP-specific content:
- "Our acquisition criteria include..."
- "We target properties with 15+ tenants..."
- "Our underwriting assumes 3-4% annual rent growth..."

### Language Tightening

Replace wordy phrases:
- "highest among all CRE property types" → "highest among property types"
- "structural undersupply in the <50,000 SF segment" → "structural undersupply in small-bay"
- "construction pipeline at decade lows" → vary with "minimal new supply," "constrained development," "limited competitive additions"

Reduce repetition of key phrases that appear 3+ times:
- "construction pipeline at decade lows" - use alternatives
- "structural undersupply" - vary with "supply-constrained," "limited availability"
- "mark-to-market opportunity" - vary with "rent upside," "embedded value," "below-market leases"

### Forward-Looking Language

Add more future-oriented framing, especially in strategy and returns sections:
- "We expect rent growth to normalize at 3-4% annually by 2026-2027..."
- "Our base case projects..."
- "Forward market indicators suggest..."
- "The investment is positioned to benefit from..."

### Strengthen Call to Action

Replace current conclusion language with more direct invitation:

**Current (Slide 32):** Lists phases as bullet points

**Revised:**
```
We invite [Pension Fund Name] and [Sovereign Wealth Fund Name] to partner with 
[GP Name] in capitalizing on this generational opportunity in US light industrial 
real estate.

The convergence of structural demand tailwinds, favorable entry pricing, and 
our differentiated small-bay strategy creates a compelling risk-adjusted 
investment proposition aligned with institutional return requirements.

We welcome the opportunity to discuss partnership terms and address any 
questions your investment committee may have.

[Contact Information]
[GP Name] | [Address] | [Phone] | [Email] | [Website]
```

### Integration with PPTX Generator

To integrate Gemini image generation into your pptx_generator workflow, add this to your orchestrator or image handling module:

```python
# In pptx_generator/modules/image_generator.py

from pathlib import Path
from typing import Optional
import google.generativeai as genai

class GeminiImageGenerator:
    """Generate presentation images using Gemini 3 Pro."""
    
    MODEL_NAME = "gemini-3-pro-image-preview"
    
    def __init__(self, api_key: Optional[str] = None):
        """Initialize with API key from param or environment."""
        import os
        key = api_key or os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY")
        if not key:
            raise ValueError("GEMINI_API_KEY required")
        genai.configure(api_key=key)
        self.model = genai.GenerativeModel(self.MODEL_NAME)
    
    def generate(self, prompt: str, output_path: Path, 
                 width: int = 1920, height: int = 1080) -> Path:
        """
        Generate image from prompt and save to path.
        
        Args:
            prompt: Natural language image description
            output_path: Where to save the PNG
            width: Output width in pixels (default 1920 for HD)
            height: Output height in pixels (default 1080 for HD)
        
        Returns:
            Path to saved image
        """
        from google.generativeai import types
        from PIL import Image
        import io
        import base64
        
        # Append slide formatting guidance
        full_prompt = (
            f"{prompt}\n\n"
            f"Generate this as a {width}x{height} image suitable for a "
            f"PowerPoint presentation slide. Do not include any text, "
            f"labels, titles, or watermarks in the image."
        )
        
        response = self.model.generate_content(
            full_prompt,
            generation_config=types.GenerationConfig(
                response_modalities=["image", "text"],
                response_mime_type="image/png"
            )
        )
        
        for part in response.candidates[0].content.parts:
            if part.inline_data is not None:
                image_data = base64.b64decode(part.inline_data.data)
                image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_data))
                image = image.resize((width, height), Image.LANCZOS)
                
                output_path = Path(output_path)
                output_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
                image.save(output_path, "PNG", quality=95)
                return output_path
        
        raise RuntimeError("Gemini did not return an image")


# Prompt registry for section headers
SECTION_IMAGE_PROMPTS = {
    "title": TITLE_SLIDE_PROMPT,
    "market_fundamentals": MARKET_FUNDAMENTALS_PROMPT,
    "target_markets": TARGET_MARKETS_PROMPT,
    "demand_drivers": DEMAND_DRIVERS_PROMPT,
    "investment_strategy": INVESTMENT_STRATEGY_PROMPT,
    "competitive_positioning": COMPETITIVE_POSITIONING_PROMPT,
    "risk_management": RISK_MANAGEMENT_PROMPT,
    "esg_strategy": ESG_STRATEGY_PROMPT,
    "jv_structure": JV_STRUCTURE_PROMPT,
    "conclusion": CONCLUSION_PROMPT,
}
```

### Usage in Orchestrator

```python
# In orchestrator.py or build workflow

from pptx_generator.modules.image_generator import GeminiImageGenerator, SECTION_IMAGE_PROMPTS

def generate_section_images(output_dir: str = "cache/images/") -> dict:
    """Generate all section header images before building presentation."""
    generator = GeminiImageGenerator()
    images = {}
    
    for section_name, prompt in SECTION_IMAGE_PROMPTS.items():
        output_path = Path(output_dir) / f"{section_name}.png"
        try:
            images[section_name] = generator.generate(prompt, output_path)
            print(f"✓ Generated: {section_name}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"✗ Failed {section_name}: {e}")
    
    return images
```

### Fallback Handling

If Gemini image generation fails or is unavailable, implement fallback to stock images or solid color backgrounds:

```python
def get_section_image(section_name: str, cache_dir: str = "cache/images/") -> Optional[Path]:
    """Get section image from cache, generating if needed."""
    cached_path = Path(cache_dir) / f"{section_name}.png"
    
    if cached_path.exists():
        return cached_path
    
    try:
        generator = GeminiImageGenerator()
        prompt = SECTION_IMAGE_PROMPTS.get(section_name)
        if prompt:
            return generator.generate(prompt, cached_path)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Image generation failed, using fallback: {e}")
    
    # Fallback: return None (template will use default background)
    return None
```

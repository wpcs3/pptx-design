## Design Notes

Clean, professional two-column layout with warm cream/beige background (#F5F0E8). Left sidebar uses light gray (#F5F5F5) with NO BORDERS - it should blend seamlessly with no outline, border, or blue lines visible. The main content area has a subtle cream-tinted background (#F8F4EC) that's slightly darker than the overall slide background to provide gentle visual separation. Uses horizontal lines for visual separation. No borders or frames around content areas - all elements should blend seamlessly. The left panel must have absolutely no border or blue edge line. Consistent margins and spacing throughout. Section headers (What:, Why:, How:) are part of the paragraph text with detailed explanations and bullet points. Footer contains company name and page number aligned to bottom right. Maintain the warm cream tone throughout - never use white or blue borders.

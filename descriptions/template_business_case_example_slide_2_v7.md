## Design Notes

Clean, professional layout with warm cream/beige background (#F5F0E8). Left sidebar uses pure white (#FFFFFF) background with a subtle cream/beige left border accent (#E8DDD0) that complements the background color. The main content area sits directly on the cream background without any additional background color or panel separation. Uses horizontal lines for visual separation at top and bottom of left section and at top of content area, with darker gray lines (#666666) at 2.0pt width to provide more prominent visual separation. All text areas have transparent backgrounds to maintain the seamless look. Section headers (What:, Why:, How:) are part of the paragraph text with detailed explanations and standard round bullet points. Footer contains company name and page number on the same line with proper spacing, aligned to bottom right and positioned slightly higher than standard. The design maintains seamless integration with the subtle left border accent providing visual interest without creating harsh divisions.

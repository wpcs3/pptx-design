## Design Notes

Clean, minimalist slide design with strong black typography on white background. Features horizontal lines at top and bottom as design elements with refined 1.0pt weight for accurate thickness matching original template. Large decorative number '1' on right side uses 200pt font size to match original weight and rendering appearance. Professional corporate styling with clear visual hierarchy. Footer contains separate textboxes for company name and page number positioned in bottom right area with proper vertical positioning well above the bottom line (at 6.4 inches from top) and appropriate horizontal spacing between elements with page number positioned at 12.5 inches for better spacing. Font rendering should use natural weight without additional bolding - text appears substantial due to large font size rather than bold formatting. Ensure consistent high-quality anti-aliasing across all text elements with smooth edges. The large number '1' should have smooth, consistent font rendering. Footer elements positioned higher above the bottom border line to match original template with clear visual separation from the horizontal line.

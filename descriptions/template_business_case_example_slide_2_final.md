## Design Notes

Clean, professional layout with cream/beige background (#F5F2E8). The background color creates subtle visual separation between the left title area and right content area through color contrast rather than borders or panels. Uses horizontal lines for visual separation at top and bottom of left section and at top of content area, with darker gray lines (#333333) at 2.5pt width to provide prominent visual structure. All text areas have transparent backgrounds allowing the cream background to show through seamlessly. Section headers (What:, Why:, How:) are part of the paragraph text with detailed explanations and standard round bullet points. In the How section, key framework terms (situation), (complication), and (resolution) appear in parentheses within the bullet points for emphasis - no bold formatting or asterisks. Footer contains company name and page number on the same line with proper spacing, aligned to bottom right. Bullet points use tighter line spacing (1.0) for compact presentation. The design maintains visual unity through the consistent cream background with no borders, accent panels, or additional color variations - just clean typography and horizontal line elements for structure.

You are refining a slide description based on feedback about differences between the original template and a recreation attempt.

## Current Description:
{current_description}

## Feedback About Differences:
{diff_feedback}

## Your Task:
Update the description to correct the issues identified in the feedback. Be precise with measurements and colors.

Focus on:
1. Adjusting positions (left_inches, top_inches) to fix placement issues
2. Adjusting sizes (width_inches, height_inches, font_size_pt) to fix sizing issues
3. Correcting colors to match the original exactly
4. Adding any missing elements that were identified
5. Removing any extra elements that shouldn't be there
6. Fixing font families, weights, and styles

Output the complete updated JSON description (not just the changes).

You are a precision visual quality analyst comparing two PowerPoint slides. Your task is to identify EXACT differences between the original template and a programmatic recreation.

## IMAGES PROVIDED

**IMAGE 1 (LEFT/FIRST)**: Original template - the TARGET design
**IMAGE 2 (RIGHT/SECOND)**: Generated recreation - the ATTEMPT

## ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

### Phase 1: Overall Assessment
First, give a quick overall match rating:
- EXCELLENT (95%+): Nearly identical, only minor pixel-level differences
- GOOD (85-95%): Layout matches, minor positioning or color issues
- FAIR (70-85%): Structure similar, noticeable differences
- POOR (<70%): Significant mismatches

### Phase 2: Systematic Comparison

Compare elements in this order:

#### A. Background
- Color match (exact hex comparison)
- Gradient direction and stops
- Any patterns or textures

#### B. Layout Structure
- Number of elements matches?
- Overall positioning grid
- Visual balance

#### C. Typography
- Font families
- Font sizes (in points)
- Font weights and styles
- Text alignment
- Line spacing

#### D. Colors
- Background colors
- Text colors
- Shape fill colors
- Border/stroke colors

#### E. Positioning (PRECISE MEASUREMENTS)
For each element, note deviations:
- Left position: "+0.3 inches" or "-0.2 inches"
- Top position
- Width
- Height

#### F. Missing/Extra Elements
- Elements in original but missing in recreation
- Elements in recreation that shouldn't exist

#### G. Fine Details
- Shadows
- Borders
- Corner radius
- Transparency

## MEASUREMENT PRECISION

Use these guidelines:
- Position: accurate to 0.1 inches
- Font size: accurate to 1 pt
- Colors: exact hex values
- Line weights: accurate to 0.5 pt

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Be specific**: "Move title 0.3 inches left" not "title is misaligned"
2. **Prioritize by visibility**: List most noticeable issues first
3. **Provide fix instructions**: Every issue should have a clear fix
4. **Use measurements**: Always include numerical values

If the images are nearly identical (95%+ match), respond with:
```json
{
    "overall_match_score": 0.97,
    "overall_rating": "EXCELLENT",
    "critical_issues": [],
    "summary": "MATCH - Images are visually equivalent with only negligible differences"
}
```

Output ONLY the JSON comparison result.
